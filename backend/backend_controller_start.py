"""
Main script to start and manage different controllers and processes for a scraping application.

This script initializes and runs multiple controllers for different components of the application in separate threads. It uses the `threading` module to concurrently execute these controllers. 

Dependencies:
    - time: For timing-related operations.
    - os: For interacting with the operating system, including file path operations.
    - sys: For system-specific parameters and functions (though not used in this script).
    - inspect: For inspecting live objects.
    - threading: For running processes concurrently.
    - subprocess: For spawning new processes.
    - apscheduler.schedulers.background: For scheduling tasks (imported but not used in this script).
    - datetime: For working with dates and times (imported but not used in this script).
